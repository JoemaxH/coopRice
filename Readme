Hello!
This project is a basic web application that connects to a MySQL database using hibernate. 
After creating a username and password or signing in the user can search the web for information 
on cooperative video games. This information is then stored in a table or "wishlist".

To use the webapp you must first have a connection to a database and tables with certain specifications.
You can obtain the connection details in the hibernate.cfg.xml file or modify them yourself to meet your
database's criteria.

To quickly populate the database with the nescesary tables you can use the following SQL commands (MySQL):

CREATE TABLE wishlist (
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
title varchar(100),
genre varchar(50),
localp int(11),
onlinep int(11),
normalPrice varchar(10),
salePrice varchar(10),
savings varchar(10),
metacriticScore int(11),
PRIMARY KEY (id));

and

CREATE TABLE logtable (
id int (11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
username varchar(50),
password varchar(50),
PRIMARY KEY (id));
